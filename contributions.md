        Description:  
            Struggled with the branches in git and getting the users in the lobby to show because of a missing REST request.  
            Now everything is working properly. Also helped implementing a way to join lobby using the lobby code.

    Description:
        I worked/help worked on the design aspect of the Website in the frontend. We focused on making a (kind of) good looking website
        and implemented the Join and Create Lobby site/buttons. (DISCLAIMER: we were a team of three in the FrontEnd therefor we all helped each           other if needed)
