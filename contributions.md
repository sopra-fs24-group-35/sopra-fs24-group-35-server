        Description:  
            Struggled with the branches in git and getting the users in the lobby to show because of a missing REST request.  
            Now everything is working properly. Also helped implementing a way to join lobby using the lobby code.

    Description:
        I worked/help worked on the design aspect of the Website in the frontend. We focused on making a (kind of) good looking website
        and implemented the Join and Create Lobby site/buttons. (DISCLAIMER: we were a team of three in the FrontEnd therefor we all helped each           other if needed)

        This was quite chaotic. We split up the team into frontend and backend and split our task in the team
        I was responsible for the Overall Design but we did not though about this when creating the Issues that this would be more efficient and therefore should be done.
        I then created this Task late Sunday to show my progress but it should have been splitted up more like this:
        Therefore I have currently just one task done on github.

        More Structured would have been:
            Issue 44 - Creating new button to click that gets you to the Game Site
            Issue x - Coming up with a fitting design for the Game Risk that other member can copy paste from. (General Design Idea)
            Issue y - Changing in Login Screen the Inputs to *
            Issue z - Create FormField and FormFieldPassword to clean up Duplicated code in the corresponding Login and Registration tsx Files. (Clean up)


    Description:
    Created a button that gets you to the new /Game site.
        Come up with a first Design at 28.3 -> Real Struggle with sccs
        After Team Inputs I redesigned everything again and came up with the current Implementation choice.
        Create SCCS Files TitleScreen
        Create RiskMainScreen.tsx
        Added FormField and FormFieldPassword
        Adjusted Login and Registration Code
